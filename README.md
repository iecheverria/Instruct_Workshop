IMP is a tool to generate structural models based on multiple sources of experimental data.  A detailed explanation of IMP and integrative modeling is given [here](https://integrativemodeling.org/nightly/doc/manual/)

### This tutorial explores scripts that:

* Show the basic capabilities of IMP
* Sample models of RNA Polymerase II subunits rpb1 and rpb2 using chemical crosslinks data
* Visualize these models and analyze them for accuracy and precision
